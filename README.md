# Admin Panel

This project now includes a comprehensive admin panel that provides administrators with the tools to manage users and monitor transactions.

## Features

- **User Management:** View a list of all users, including their names, email addresses, roles, and credit balances. Edit and delete users as needed.
- **Transaction Monitoring:** Track all transactions, including the transaction ID, amount, credits purchased, plan, and the user who made the transaction.

## How to Access

To access the admin panel, you must be logged in as an administrator. Once logged in, navigate to the `/admin` route to access the panel.
